	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>
	
	During ENGL 3844, I collected data and used that data to create the following data
	story. I wanted insight into my productivity at work, so I tracked my app usage while
	I was at work and came up with these results.

	While collecting data, I had a spreadsheet to fill in with as much information as
	possible that I could use later on. I tracked which apps I was using at work, where
	I was when I used them, the times and how long I used each app, who I was with when
	I opened an app, what my intentions were while using the apps, what type of app each
	one was, and how much work I completed or did not complete while on my phone.

		<h4>Data Visualization</h4>

		As shown, the data visualization I created shows all of the data I collected in
		a smaller, easy to understand way. Each app's logo is prominent in the center, and
		the circles around the logos hold a lot of meaning. The thickness of the circle
		represents the timespan of using the app, and the color represents where I was at
		work when I used it. Each symbol on top of the circle also holds a meaning that
		can be seen in the visualization key at the top.

		For a broader context, I researched information about how apps or websites use
		your information and sometimes without your knowledge. The video explains ways
		that social media sites share your information and how certain apps and websites
		track your location. Examples are provided as well as information about what you
		should do to prevent this from happening.

		<h6>Conclusion</h6>
		
		<p>
		
		My data collection and research in ENGL 3844 was insightful and a learning
		experience. Through my data collection and visualization, I found that I use
		Instagram the most while on my phone, and the location and people I'm with while
		at work affect the amount of work I complete. I also found that I tend to just
		scroll through apps with no actual purpose most of the time.
		
		As explained in the video, I also learned about social practices when it comes to
		personal data like how apps track you and your location.
